An innovative programmer with more than 5 years of
 professional experience in software design and development.
Thrive in a team environment with the ability to lead and
 follow leadership directives.
Understanding intricate systems and solving complex problems 
in a dynamic and result-oriented way is one of my strong
 suits (writing short sentences is not).
Able to coordinate several projects simultaneously
 while prioritizing tasks and operating proactively.
I aspire to be language-agnostic and like learning
 new programming languages and exploring new frameworks.
